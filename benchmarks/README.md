# Benchmarks

```bash
PYTHONPATH=.. python benchmarks/matmul_baseline.py
```

The script saves JSON in `results/raw/`. It defaults to a small `1 x 256` by `256 x 256` float16 matmul, with 10 warmups and 30 timed repetitions. Use `--m`, `--k`, `--n`, and `--dtype` to change the workload.

The default `--timing-mode eager` preserves the original method: one Python-submitted matmul between CUDA events. For tiny workloads, that interval can include host submission gaps. To reduce this effect, run the separately labeled graph-replay method:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=.. python benchmarks/matmul_baseline.py --timing-mode graph --graph-ops 100
```

Graph mode captures 100 matmuls, times each replay, and divides replay time by 100. This reports amortized time per operation under graph replay, not eager end-to-end latency or isolated kernel duration. Compare results only when their timing modes match.
